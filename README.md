# 1. Motion triggered Neopixel RGB shoes
This project uses a Vibration Sensor Module, Arduino Nano and Neopixel RGB LEDs to light up a shoe based on the wearer's motion. Neopixels are individually addressable RGB LEDs all housed on a string that can be controlled from a single pin on a microcontroller. This means one pin can control all of the LEDs colors and which LEDs are on at any given time. A vibration sensor module is used to sense the motion of the wearer. Based on the input from the vibration sensor, the Neopixels light up.
