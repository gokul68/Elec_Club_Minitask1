# 1. Motion triggered Neopixel RGB shoes
This project uses a Vibration Sensor Module, Arduino Nano and Neopixel RGB LEDs to light up a shoe based on the wearer's motion. Neopixels are individually addressable RGB LEDs all housed on a string that can be controlled from a single pin on a microcontroller. This means one pin can control all of the LEDs colors and which LEDs are on at any given time. A vibration sensor module is used to sense the motion of the wearer. Based on the input from the vibration sensor, the Neopixels light up.

# 2. Raspberry Pi based Weather Station
An aesthetically pleasing weather forecast for Raspberry Pi Zero W and Ili9341 based 2.8 inch TFT. The Raspberry Pi Zero W is a small computer with wireless and bluetooth capabilities. The weather data is retrieved from the internet and displayed on the AZ-Touchscreen. The touchscreen has a 2.8 inch TFT.

# 3. Tape Measure Clock
This project converts a normal measuring tape into a clock using Arduino Nano and Stepper Motors. The length on the tape indicates the time in hours. The tape measure is motorized and programmed to move over the course of the day to show the time in hours (inches).
