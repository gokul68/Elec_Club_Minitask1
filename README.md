# 1. Motion triggered Neopixel RGB shoes
This project uses a Vibration Sensor Module, Arduino Nano and Neopixel RGB LEDs to light up a shoe based on the wearer's motion. Neopixels are individually addressable RGB LEDs all housed on a string that can be controlled from a single pin on a microcontroller. This means one pin can control all of the LEDs colors and which LEDs are on at any given time. A vibration sensor module is used to sense the motion of the wearer. Based on the input from the vibration sensor, the Neopixels light up.

# 4. IRIS - the Lamp That Knows When You're Around
This project is basically a smart lamp which turns on based on the whether the user is detected. It has other features also, including adaptive brightness, lighting up the users path when they want to go somewhere in the middle of the night, and a manual mode. It can also toggle between manual and smart mode when the sun sets. It uses a proximity sensor to detect the user, warm white LED strips for the lamp, a relay and an Arduino Uno.

# 5. Spherical Quadruped Arduino Robot
This project is a spherical quadruped robot. The base of the robot is a quadruped platform with two articulations by leg and all integrated into a spherical frame. On standby mode, the robot looks like a sphere and transforms itself into quadruped to move. An ultrasonic sensor is used to avoid clash during motion. The bot has 10 servomotors and an Arduino Nano.

# 6. Arduino Anti-Dog Trash Can
This project is basically a modified trash can to prevent dogs from taking trash from it. It has a limit switch on the lid, and if the lid is open for 5 seconds it will play the owners voice on a speaker near the trash can telling the dog to go away. It uses an Arduino Uno, a 9-12 V speaker, and a microSD card module to store the audio recordings.

# 9. Tongue Typing With a Mouth Mouse 
This project is basically a tongue controlled mouse + keyboard. It makes use of something known as the Makey Makey board, a board with simple connections used as an interface with a computer that is primarily used for educational projects. When implemented here, each tooth can correspond to a key/mouse movement.

# 10. Equalised Headphone Amp for Hearing Impaired
This project is a headphone amplifier for people with hearing aids. The frequency can be adjusted based on the hearing aids. The circuit board is designed using Eagle. An equation is used to determine the frequency requirements for a particular hearing aid. The circuit is placed in a 3d printed box.

# 11. MOLBED - Modular Low Cost Braille Electronic Display
The goal of this project is to create an electronic Braille system that is affordable and can make this technology available to everyone. Each "dot" on a character module is made up of 2 3D printed parts (Body and Magnet holder), 2 M2 nuts, 2 magnets, and 0.1mm enameled wire. A controlling PCB also hold the bodies.

# 15. Ultrasonic Sound Gun (Parametric Speaker)
A gun that shoots out a narrow beam of ultrasonic audio. The sound can only be heard by people inside the narrow beam, or through a nearby source when the audio gets demodulated. It works by taking an audio source, in this case a Bluetooth speaker circuit, which then gets modulated to 40khz through a 555 timer circuit. From the 555 timer the output gets amplified and then is then sent to an array of ultrasonic transducers.
